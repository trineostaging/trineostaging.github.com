Railscamp NZ 2
--------------

The Trineo bespoke solutions team attended Railscamp NZ 2 last weekend, and had an amazing time.  The event was a real success, and was appreciated by many.  Really a very satisyfing feeling for me as an organiser to have seen the number of people who put aside the time and money to be there and be a part of it.

[Check out the flickr photo group](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1922557@N21/) to get a feel for the location - right in the heart of the Kiwi alps.  Misty mountains, dappled sunlight and fierce sunny rays with clear blue sky were the order of the weekend.

The attendees hacked, talked, played werewolf and feasted on the fine catering that was arranged ... not to mention drank a reasonably large amount of craft beers that were hauled up the mountain.

We met new people, made new friends, gathered with old friends from afar and it was just a blast.  One particular comment summed it up, "I've never met a community that allowed me to start as a complete newby on Friday night and have developed my first project within 36 hours - can't believe the support and comraderie here".  I paraphrase this slightly however one non Ruby or Rails developer who turned up got a heck of a lot out of it ... well done to those who helped him.

What Next?
----------

As an active member of the Christchurch Ruby or Rails community I aim to continue with our monthly christhurch-on-rails gatherings.  I'm also quite keen to take Team Trineo to more Railscamps if the planets align.  Last year, I presented at the University of Canterbury - an expos√© of a day in the life of a Ruby developer - demonstrating TDD techniques, deployment to cloud platforms and discussing how we handle user stories, iterating through frequent releases of features and seeking ongoing acceptance from our clients...a reasonably exhaustive overview.  I aim to do more of the same.  Christchurch NZ has seen a rough year, and I aim to put it on the map as a place with a vibrant and talented RoR community.
