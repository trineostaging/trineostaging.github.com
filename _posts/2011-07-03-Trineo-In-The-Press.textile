On February the 22nd, Abhinav had a long phone interview with Tamlyn Stewart of The Press.  All of Tamlyn's notes and materials were destroyed in the earthquake, and so we regathered again to be interviewed.

The difference in Trineo between late February and late June is astounding.  An expanded team, our fourth office move, and a bigger and global client base.

Tamlyn's article is now available on "(external) stuff.co.nz":http://www.stuff.co.nz/the-press/business/christchurch-business/5223170/Software-firm-finds-cloud-nine
