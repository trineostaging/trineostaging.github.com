Partnering with the sublime business team at [Rush Labs](http://rushlabs.com), we have been working on the creation and delivery of [MarketScout](http://marketscout.com.au) since August 2010.

Recently we submitted MarketScout as a [Heroku](http://heroku.com) centric case study to the organisers of [CloudBeat](http://venturebeat.com/events/cloudbeat2011/) which is run by well known VC publisher [VentureBeat](http://venturebeat.com).

Our submission made the cut, and so [Abhinav](/crew.html#ak) turns back around to head back to the US - representing the team's efforts in this audacious venture.

From the CloudBeat website:

_Taking a hands on approach, MarketScout CTO Abhinav Keswani has led a small, nimble and talented team from inception to delivering a feature rich product for the marketplace. MarketScout is a product that allows decision makers to achieve competitive advantage by aggregating, integrating and visualising economic and business information about their competitors, suppliers,customers and peers. By using Heroku, MarketScout has been able to move at a rapid pace, allowing them to scale at the appropriate time. It has also provided a robust platform that lets the startup focus on the form and function of their product while absolving them of the need to cater for traditional infrastructural concerns that would otherwise impose cost (time and money) on a venture that needs to execute fast and deliver._
