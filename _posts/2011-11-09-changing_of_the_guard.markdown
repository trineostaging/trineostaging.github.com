Trineo is a small and nimble crew, and we pride ourselves on having a tight, adaptable and very capable team.  Trineo _is_ the team.

Over the last two years, we've recruited three University of Canterbury students and have employed them as part time staff as they complete their degrees.

Today we introduce [Greg Signal](/crew.html#gs) as our current intern, and with great pride we see [Jack Galilee](/crew.html#jg) make the transition to a full time capacity in our Bespoke Solutions team.

Luke, Morgan and Jack are core team members, and we look forward to bringing Greg into the fold.

Onwards...
