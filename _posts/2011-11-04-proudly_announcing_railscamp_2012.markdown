Railscamp NZ 2012 is being held in February 2012, at the [Snowline Lodge on Mt
Cheeseman](http://www.mtcheeseman.co.nz/summer).  For those who don't know about this place, it's really quite
something.  A remote location, perched in the majestic Southern Alps of New
Zealand - attendees will be housed in the comfort of an alpine lodge while
enjoying incredible surroundings.

Trineo is really pleased to sponsor 7 of our team to attend the camp, to sponsor
tees for the camp attendees, and proud of the great event sponsorship provided our partner
[Heroku](http://heroku.com).

A huge shout out to the event organisers who have put in a lot of work to get
this up and running:

  Ltd](http://wholemeal.co.nz)
* [Phil Arndt](http://twitter.com/parndt) of [Resolve
  Digital](http://resolvedigital.com)
* our very own [Abhinav Keswani](http://twitter.com/wasabhi)
