With the Spring 12 release of Salesforce.com upon us it's time again for Salesforce.com users in Christchurch to get together and discuss their favourite new features.

Some of the fantastic new features in Spring 12 relate to improvements in reporting and with that in mind Aaron Reid from Tait Radio will demo some of the new reporting capabilities.

* When: Thursday March 1st 2012, 5.30pm
* Where: Trineo, Unit 2C, 105 Gasson Street, Christchurch. 

RSVP: events@trineo.co.nz

And as always if you need to be bribed drinks and nibbles will be provided.
