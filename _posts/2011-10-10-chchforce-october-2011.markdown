In the past, attempts have been made to form a Christchurch Salesforce.com Usergroup. Itâ€™s been well over a year since the last meetup so we are well overdue to get together.

The Winter 12 release of Salesforce.com goes live in the next week, so what better time to get together and discuss the new features and how we could all take advantage of them.

*  When: Thursday 27 October 2011, 5:30pm
*  Where: Trineo, Unit 2C, 105 Gasson Street, Sydenham, Christchurch
*  What: Dan Fowlie from Trineo to present new Winter 12 features

RSVP: events@trineo.co.nz

And if you need to be bribed... drinks and nibbles will be provided.

We hope to see lots of Salesforce.com users and with any luck we can make this a semi-regular gathering after each major Salesforce.com release.
