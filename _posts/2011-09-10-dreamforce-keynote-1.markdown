This week Dan and Abhi have travelled to San Francisco for the Salesforce.com Dreamforce 2011 conference. With 45,000 registered attendees this is now the biggest conference in technology.

This morning was the first keynote address and in my opinion it was a step up from previous years - and even featured MC Hammer. Some really great stuff was announced.

Social Contacts
---------------

Your contacts will no doubt have a presence on the internet and social contacts brings that information into Salesforce. The feature brings in information from LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. These services help paint a more vivid picture of your contacts so you can target marketing towards their likes.

Data Residency Option
---------------------

No details were as to how this would work but it was described as "store sensitive data in your own data centre." Some companies have sensitivities around data in the cloud and this is designed to address those - but another thought I had is that it may help the migration of legacy apps if you can leave the legacy database where it is and put a Force.com front end over the top.

Salesforce Touch
----------------

You've always been able to view Salesforce on your iPad through the web browser but it doesn't behave how you expect and iPad app to behave. Touch addresses this and from what was demonstrated looks very cool. No limitations - all of your standard and custom objects are there and will display on any mobile device in a manner that suits the size of the device.

Next generation Chatter
-----------------------

Chatter can now be extended to your customers so you can get customer feedback in Chatter groups.  A new feature called Chatter Now brings instant messaging that behaves just like Facebook Chat. Screen sharing is available thanks to the acquisition of DimDim a few months ago. 

And so much more.....
---------------------

Too much to mention but think talking cars and coke machines that chatter.

We'll have another update tomorrow.
