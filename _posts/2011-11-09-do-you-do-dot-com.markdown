Salesforce.com today released Do.com, a simple project management tool, into public beta.

Do.com is the result of an acquisition that Salesforce.com made a few months back when they acquired Manymoon.com. Based on Manymoon, Do.com has been rebuilt in HTML5 and now runs on Salesforce.com's Heroku platform.

Do is simple and elegant. Concepts are loose and users won't get forced into entering a number of mandatory fields just to create a task. Do goes with a less is more approach and in a lot of instances the detail is actually hidden unless you explicitly want to see it.

For me the exciting part of Do.com is the gmail integration. Most requests from clients arrive via email so being able to create a task with a single click will be a real time saver.

There is talk of API's and being able to build extensions for Do.com. This will be a big step towards closing the loop with other systems. And of course there is a mobile app. Tighter integration with Salesforce.com would have been great, I'm sure that will come.

Check out Do.com today!
