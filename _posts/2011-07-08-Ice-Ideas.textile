It was inspiring to attend the Ice Ideas conference in Auckland today. The event attracted an extremely high calibre speaker list who were to be short and sharp with only a few minutes each to speak. One of the speakers was Paypal cofounder and early Facebook investor Peter Theil who has shown an interest in investing in New Zealand companies. The challenge was laid down for those in the room to help create 3000 new exporting companies by 2020 and help New Zealand climb the global ranks.
