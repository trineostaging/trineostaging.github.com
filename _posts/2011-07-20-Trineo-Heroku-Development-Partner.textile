"(externa) Heroku":http://heroku.com is our cloud deployment platform of choice.  It allows us to focus on developing applications as opposed to managing servers, and worrying about ongoing operations.

The efforts of the bespoke team have recently been recognised - as we are now listed in the Heroku Development Partner Program - humbly standing now beside other great companies who we admire and respect.

This makes Trineo the first company to achieve both Salesforce.com Registered Partner and Heroku Development Partner in Australia and New Zealand.
