                In 2011 DJCA were named Xero Partner of the Year. With their fresh
                approach to accounting and fast growth, DJCA required a CRM system
                that could handle their demands and integrate well with other
                systems. Trineo has worked with DJCA from day one of their
                Salesforce.com deployment to deliver a solution to meet their
                requirements. DJCA believe in the way of the cloud and a key
                requirement was integrating with other cloud systems. Trineo has
                built integrations with Workflowmax and Xero so there is no double
                handling of data. Most recently Trineo has delivered the
                innovative Insights Report that DJCA deliver to their customers.

                Salesforce.com can achieve and Trineo has been with them to
